# rs-8chip-interpreter

NOTE: old project from 2023, the code is likely shit, don't use.

This is my take on the famous CHIP-8 system and it's emulation.

# What has been implemented so far?

- CPU
- Memory
- Display
- keypad

# TODO List

- Debugger
- Improve Code
- SUPER-CHIP support (?)
- Something else?
